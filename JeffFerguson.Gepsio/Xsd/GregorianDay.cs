	/// <para>
	/// This class should be considered deprecated and will most likely be removed in a future version of Gepsio. In early CTPs,
	/// Gepsio implemented its own XML schema parser, and this class was created for the implementation of the XML schema parser
	/// type system. In later CTPs, Gepsio levergaed the XML schema support already available in the .NET Framework, which rendered
	/// Gepsio's XML schema type system obsolete.
