# What is Gepsio?
Gepsio is a document object model for [XBRL](https://www.xbrl.org/) documents. The object model is built using .NET 6 and will work with any software development platform that can consume .NET 6 assemblies.

Load your XBRL document with the `XbrlDocument` class and work with your XBRL document exposed as a set of .NET 6 classes with a variety of properties and methods. Loaded XBRL documents are automatically validated against the information against the XBRL specification, and exceptions are thrown when invalid XBRL documents are loaded. The Gepsio code base is unit tested using the [XBRL Conformance Suite](https://specifications.xbrl.org/release-history-base-spec-conformance-suite.html) designed by the XBRL organization.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/JeffFerguson/gepsio/wiki) includes a section called "Working with Gepsio" that describes how to use Gepsio to work with XBRL document instances.
